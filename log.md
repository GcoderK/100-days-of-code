# #100DaysOfCode log

## Round 1 - Started on January 07th, 2021 (Thursday)

### R1D1

**Today's Progress:** Started with the intro & basics of 'Scientific Computing with Python' in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Restarting my programming journey. It's been a long break. Hoping to stick to the plan this time, and making myself accountable by committing to #100DaysOfCode. After today, I'm glad that I'm back on track.

### R1D2

**Today's Progress:** Done with intro, variables, expressions, statements, operators, conditions & structures, exception handling, and functions.

**Thoughts:** A good starting point for anyone who doesn't know to code. Enjoying so far.

### R1D3 & R1D4

**Today's Progress:** Read blogs on how to use github, & forked repo for this challenge. Didn't read much on Python
which I was supposed to.

**Thoughts:** Hard to maintain focus. Often getting distracted. Trying too keep myself focused and accountable.

### R1D5

**Today's Progress:** Read in detail and cleared most of my confusions about git, github (sticking with this) & gitlab. Also completed exercise 04-06 in FCC's Python.

**Thoughts:** With practise, will be able to master github. For now, pushing commits for this repository from local.

### R1D6

**Today's Progress:** Studied different types of Loops & Iterations. Done with Strings too. Completed exercise 06-05.

**Thoughts:** Being familiar with loops, I was able to be done with it sooner than expected. Strings, and its methods & functions were a bit of a new concept. Was interesting to read about them.

### R1D7

**Today's Progress:** Read about reading files, lists, and dictionaries. Covered a lot of new topics. Worked on the examples and their applications. Completed exercises 07-01, 08 & 09.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to learn about lists & dictionaries. Looks like Data structures play an important factor.

### R1D8

**Today's Progress:** Studied about Tuples. Also read about Regular Expressions (RegEx) for matching and extracting data. Completed example 10.

**Thoughts:** Data Structures is amazing. Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries make the code look simplified and elegant. RegEx is cool, but need to get familiar with the expressions.

### R1D9

**Today's Progress:** Read about topics related to networking with Python. Learnt how to write a web scraping script.

**Thoughts:** This concept and syntaxes were new to me. Though I've basic knowledge about networking, implementing them with python was new. Need another revision to get more familiarized with the script.

### R1D10

**Today's Progress:** Done with the examples of networking with Python in FCC. Many example programs were provided, which needs to be gone through. Additionally, solved a binary sequence problem from hackerearth, which was referred to me by an acquaintance.

**Thoughts:** Networking with Python and its programs still need a proper read. Solving the hackerearth problem was a good exercise to the brain. Felt amazing.

### R1D11

**Today's Progress:** Being a Sunday, took a break from learning. Solved a couple warmup problems from CodeSignal & HackerRank, and registered myself in other platforms - LeetCode and HackerEarth.

**Thoughts:** It was good to know that I remembered and implemented what I learnt. Keeps me motivated to keep continuing this challenge.

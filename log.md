# #100DaysOfCode log

## Round 1 - Started on January 07th, 2021 (Thursday)

### R1D1

**Today's Progress:** Started with the intro & basics of 'Scientific Computing with Python' in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Restarting my programming journey. It's been a long break. Hoping to stick to the plan this time, and making myself accountable by committing to #100DaysOfCode. After today, I'm glad that I'm back on track.

### R1D2

**Today's Progress:** Done with intro, variables, expressions, statements, operators, conditions & structures, exception handling, and functions.

**Thoughts:** A good starting point for anyone who doesn't know to code. Enjoying so far.

### R1D3 & R1D4

**Today's Progress:** Read blogs on how to use github, & forked repo for this challenge. Didn't read much on Python
which I was supposed to.

**Thoughts:** Hard to maintain focus. Often getting distracted. Trying too keep myself focused and accountable.

### R1D5

**Today's Progress:** Read in detail and cleared most of my confusions about git, github (sticking with this) & gitlab. Also completed exercise 04-06 in FCC's Python.

**Thoughts:**  With practise, will be able to master github. For now, pushing commits for this repository from local.

### R1D6

**Today's Progress:** Studied different types of Loops & Iterations. Done with Strings too. Completed exercise 06-05.

**Thoughts:**  Being familiar with loops, I was able to be done with it sooner than expected. Strings, and its methods & functions were a bit of a new concept. Was interesting to read about them.

### R1D7

**Today's Progress:** Read about reading files, lists, and dictionaries. Covered a lot of new topics. Worked on the examples and their applications. Completed exercises 07-01, 08 & 09.

**Thoughts:**  It was interesting to learn about lists & dictionaries. Looks like Data structures play an important factor.

# #100DaysOfCode log

## Round 1 - Started on January 07th, 2021 (Thursday)

### R1D1

**Today's Progress:** Started with the intro & basics of 'Scientific Computing with Python' in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Restarting my programming journey. It's been a long break. Hoping to stick to the plan this time, and making myself accountable by committing to #100DaysOfCode. After today, I'm glad that I'm back on track.

### R1D2

**Today's Progress:** Done with intro, variables, expressions, statements, operators, conditions & structures, exception handling, and functions.

**Thoughts:** A good starting point for anyone who doesn't know to code. Enjoying so far.

### R1D3 & R1D4

**Today's Progress:** Read blogs on how to use github, & forked repo for this challenge. Didn't read much on #Python
which I was supposed to.

**Thoughts:** Hard to maintain focus. Often getting distracted. Trying too keep myself focused and accountable.
